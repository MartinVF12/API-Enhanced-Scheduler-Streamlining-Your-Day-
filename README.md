## Code Description

The provided JavaScript code is for a Work Day Scheduler application. It leverages various features to help users manage their daily tasks and events within standard business hours (9AM to 5PM). Here's a breakdown of what this code does:

- **Saving Events**: When the user clicks the "Save" button associated with a specific time block, the JavaScript code captures the hour and event description for that time block. It then stores this information in the browser's local storage, associating it with the specific hour.

- **Updating Time Blocks**: The application updates the visual representation of time blocks to reflect the current time. Time blocks are color-coded:
  - Past time blocks have a gray background.
  - The present time block is highlighted with a different color.
  - Future time blocks have a distinct appearance.

- **Loading Saved Events**: Upon loading or refreshing the page, the code retrieves previously saved events from local storage and populates the respective time blocks with the stored event descriptions.

- **Current Date Display**: The header of the page displays the current date in a user-friendly format (e.g., "Monday, January 1, 2024").

- **Real-Time Updates**: The code updates the time block colors every minute to accurately reflect the current time, ensuring that the "present" block dynamically changes as time progresses.

The application is designed to help users manage their daily schedules effectively within the specified working hours. It provides a visual representation of past, present, and future tasks, along with the ability to save and retrieve events. The combination of these features creates a simple and interactive workday scheduler.
